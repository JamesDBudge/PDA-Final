# create a collection of numbers.

# For every number in the collection starting with the first I compare it to the next number in the collection.

# If the first number is larger than the second I switch their positions.

# When a switch is performed I record that a switch has occurred.

# Iterate over the whole collection until no switches are performed in a single pass.

# The collection is now sorted.
